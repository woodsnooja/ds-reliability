# Core Skills - Data science in reliability course

## About this course

Reliability analysis on in-service assets uses well-established methods to, for example, determine mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) estimates or identify failure modes. However, the data inputs to these calculations depend on how the raw data from maintenance repair records has been processed. Processes to extract and clean raw maintenance data are often ad hoc and performed differently by each engineer. As a result calculations for asset reliability measures and identification of historical events and failure modes are difficult to replicate. Currently, the process is manual, time-consuming and not scalable. 

The goal of this course is to enable practicing reliablity engineers to use state of the art, open-source code-based tools, to interrogate their maintenance work order data and extract MTBF values and failure mode information.

## Audience for this course

Target participants are involved in maintenance strategy development, day-to-day reliability analysis of existing plant, reliability improvement efforts, or maintenance management metrics.

Participants need to have 1) an understanding of how Weibull parameters are used in characerising failure behaviour (wear in, wear out and random) and for settting intervals in maintenance strategy development and 2) be able to understand simple characterisation of statistical distributions such as mean and variance. 

The material in this course can be applied to all asset classes: rotating equipment, mobile, linear, electrical and computing infrastructure so this is open to all engineering disciplines working in reliability engineering roles.

## Learning outcomes 

At the end of this course participants should be able to:

1. Estimate the parameters for a Weibull distribution on the life of an asset from maintenance work order data.
2. Determine key failure modes for an asset from maintenance work order data.
3. Describe the impact of pre-processing decisions on outputs.

## Getting access

All course content is delivered using a virtual cloud server using Jupyter notebooks. Examples of these notebooks are available on this Gitsite. These are comprised of text and Python code blocks. 

The code blocks are used to demonstrate the data processing and calculations. There is no need to be able to code in Python yourself. 

Participants in the course will use three browser windows, one accessing the Notebooks (for content), one for Menti (for anonymised Q&A) and one for Teams (to communicate with the presenters and other participants).
