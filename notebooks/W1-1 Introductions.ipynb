    "* Reliability analysis uses well-established statistical methods to determine performance parameters e.g. mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) estimates.\n",
    "* However, the data inputs to these calculations depend on how the raw data from maintenance repair records has been processed. \n",
    "* Processes to extract and clean raw maintenance data are often ad hoc and performed differently by each engineer. \n",
    "* As a result calculations for asset reliability measures, identification of historical failure and repair events and failure modes are difficult to replicate. \n",
    "* Currently, the process is manual, time-consuming and not scalable. "
